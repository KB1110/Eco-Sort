Eco-Sort: AI-Based Dry Waste Segregator 

As part of AICTE's prestigious The Inventor's Challenge 2023, I led a dynamic team into the finals by developing an innovative solution to tackle the pressing issue of dry waste management. Our solution was designed to efficiently sort dry waste into four distinct categories – Plastic, Paper, Metal, and Other – leveraging cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices.

Leveraged the advanced capabilities of the dual-core STM32H747XIH6 Arm-based microcontroller to power our AI algorithms and seamlessly control the electronics hardware.

Utilized state-of-the-art Computer Vision techniques and a network of sensors to accurately identify and segregate waste into multiple categories. Through Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow Model Zoo, we achieved an impressive 90% accuracy rate, ensuring efficient sorting and recycling processes.

In addition to technical innovation, our project exemplified effective teamwork and leadership. I played a pivotal role in coordinating project tasks, fostering collaboration among team members, and ensuring the successful execution of our objectives.
